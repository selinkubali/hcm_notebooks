    "# Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Genes Cross-Validation\n",
    "##### Selin Kubali\n",
    "##### 12/13/2023\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Find out whether we can distinguish the HCM risk of bottom 25% and top 25% of missense and deleterious variant carriers in key hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-related genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the code functions\n",
    "Use cross-validation to fit a Cox-PH model and predict hazard scores. Then isolate the bottom 25% and top 25% of carriers by hazard score and calculate whether there is a statistically significant difference in HCM between them use the Mann-Whitney U test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is done by splitting on variant data, to ensure there are an equal number of variants in each fold and prevent overfitting on high-frequency variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs\n",
    "Lifelines files - from running generate_extracts_gnomAD.ipynb on UKBiobank in Cassa Lab Shared Project/selected_genes/hcm/notebooks. Stored in Cassa Lab Shared Project/selected_genes/hcm/lifelines_data. \n",
    "Variant data files - from running vep_processing.ipynb on UKBiobank in Cassa Lab Shared Project/selected_genes/hcm/notebooks. Stored in Cassa Lab Shared Project/selected_genes/hcm/parsed_vep_files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "Two HCM related genes - DES and PLN - were eliminated for having too few variants to converge.\n",
    "PTPN11, TNNI3, and TTR each have few cases of HCM with missense or deleterious variants, which may harm convergence."
